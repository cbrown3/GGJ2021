game ideas:
- player 1 has vision of their immediate surroundings either from a circle or cone coming from them (flashlight)
- player 1 has to communicate with player 2 to figure out how to solve the puzzle/escape the room
- player 2 has vision of an indiviudal room, and can switch between rooms
- player 1 is being chased by an enemy
- enemy only chases player 1 if player 2 is not currently looking at it
- if player 2 looks at enemy for too long then the camera malfunctions/they get stunned/w.e inconvenience
- player 2 sees obstacles in the room, maybe more than are actually there -- extraneous stuff
- player 1 has to filter through the misinformation coming from player 2
- if player 2s camera gets stunned they don't know it
- maybe player 1 can see enemy and player 2 can see traps but not vice-versa
- periodic camera outtages that player 1 needs to reset
- cameras have limited time of use
- player 1 refreshes camera time with batteries
